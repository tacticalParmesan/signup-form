# aQuietSpace

aQuietspace is a totally real renting service for coworking spaces, featuring individual seats and cozy conference rooms.
Since it's a service - a PaaS (Place as a service) if you like, there is a mandatory registration form.

This is a project tackled during the Odin Project, aimed to exercise newly acquired skills about forms elements.
It features the classic form fields each with its own validation and - and that is quite an achievment for my current 
proficiency in Web Dev which I am really proud of - it's optimized also for mobile, it's responsive! Everything will
collapse in a single column with a backgroud when the screen goes belowe a certain size. No Grid was used for this,
only flexbox.
